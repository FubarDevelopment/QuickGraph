# QuickGraph

This is a fork of [QuickGraph from CodePlex](https://quickgraph.codeplex.com/).
The intent is to keep all original features, like:

- [x] Contracts
- [x] Wiki pages
- [ ] Issues

I'm trying to find a way to import the discussions and maybe issues are an option.
Another solution might be importing them into a team discussion - or just converting
them to Wiki pages.
